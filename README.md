--- Animal patient tracking ---
I developed an animal patient tracking application in TypeScript, using Zustand for efficient global status management. I implemented React Hook Form to optimize data capture and validation in patient registration and update forms. In addition, I integrated React Toastify to provide real-time notifications, improving the user experience. The application allows veterinarians and caregivers to register, update and consult the history of each patient in a simple and intuitive way, ensuring agile and organized management.
